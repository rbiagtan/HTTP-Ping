.DESCRIPTION
This tool will perform a HTTP GET looking for a RESPONSE value of 200 indicating the website is up.
A timestamped YES or NO is written to a log file. The script will run in an infinite loop.

Toolmaker: Rod Biagtan
Date: August 30, 2017
Version: 0.1

Things that would improve the tool:
    - Variable for website
    - Option to ping infinitely or set number
    - Option to store the log file in desired directory
    - Create the log file if it doesn't exist
    - Variable for Start-Sleep
#>

# First we create the request
$HTTP_Request = [System.Net.WebRequest]::Create('http://google.com')

# We then get a response from the site
$HTTP_Response = $HTTP_Request.GetResponse()

# We then get the HTTP code as an integer
$HTTP_Status = [int]$HTTP_Response.StatusCode

while($true)
{
    $i++
    
    # Variables
    $startTime = Get-Date
    
    # Valid response
    If ($HTTP_Status -eq 200) { 
        Add-Content C:\b4all\Utilities\HTTP_request_ping_log.txt ([string]$startTime + " YES - the site is OK!") 
    }
    # Invalid response
    Else {
        
        Add-Content C:\b4all\Utilities\HTTP_request_ping_log.txt ([string]$startTime + " NO - the site may be DOWN!")
    }

    # Clean up the http request by closing it
    $HTTP_Response.Close()
    
    # Wait a set number of seconds before looping
    start-sleep -Seconds 1
}
